# Proveably Random Raffle Contract

This project demonstrates a decentralized lottery system implemented using Solidity and tested with Foundry. It includes scripts for deploying the contract and interacting with it, and various unit and staging tests to ensure functionality.

This project is part of the Cyfrin Foundry course and serves as a practical example of how to build, deploy, and test a lottery smart contract using Foundry. The lottery allows users to enter by paying a fee, and a random winner is picked at regular intervals using Chainlink VRF.
